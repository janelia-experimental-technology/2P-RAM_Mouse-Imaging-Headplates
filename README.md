### Head Plate for Mouse 2P-RAM Imaging

Researchers at Janelia have designed several head plates for live imaging of a mouse using a downward-facing objective in collaboration with jET. It is specially designed to work with the 2P-RAM (2-photon random access mesoscope).



The head plate is attached to the skull of the mouse. It is used to secure the head to the microscope. The design is distinguished by a shallow profile and is secured on only one side of the animal. Thus, it is ideal for use with the  2P-RAM objective, which is much larger than a conventional microscope objective.
